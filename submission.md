## Aviation’s Harmful Impact on Climate
The aviation industry has undergone many innovations over the past century to advance aircraft; however, its environmental impact wasn’t factored in. Today, approximately 2.5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are produced by the aviation industry, and aviation accounts for 4% of global climate change (Ritchie 2024). Aircraft contribute to climate change through contrails (white streaks left behind by aircraft), cloud formation, CO2 emissions and NOx emissions (Lee et al. 2009). GHG emissions from aircraft can be mitigated by synthetic aviation fuel (SAFs) and fuel-efficient engines. Unlike fossil fuels, SAFs are a renewable fuel derived from human waste and biomass, such as oils and fats (Shahriar and Khanal 2022). Furthermore, Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney are designing and manufacturing fuel-efficient engines that maintain power output with minimal fuel use and GHG emissions (Pratt & Whitney 2015) (Aerovision International 2021).

## Key Results and Takeaways from FaIR Modelling
The Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model can be used to predict temperature increases due to CO2, NOx and the impact of GHG on Earth’s energy levels (Smith et al., 2018). We modelled the increase in temperature over 100 years attributable to CO2 from the novel Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines and computed a contribution of approximately 0.05°C. We modelled best and worst-case scenarios (conservative and aggressive forecasts of Pratt & Whitney’s engine efficiency) and found significant differences between their curvature over the same 100-year epoch (p = 9.99*10-4) _(Figure 1)_. Considerations for the compound annual growth rate of aviation travel were implemented into a secondary model and should be further explored.

_Figure 1: A comparison of the four scenarios using RTX Pratt & Whitney engines, modelled using FaIR in this review, wherein A = aggressive (30% engine efficiency), C = conservative (25% engine efficiency), S = synthetic fuel-efficient engine, T = traditional non-fuel-efficient engine. Each scenario is run for the next 100 years, starting at 2026, ending 2125._
